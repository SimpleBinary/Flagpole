# Flagpole
A python program that recognises flags of different countries

## How does it work?

It uses a simple image hash library called `imagehash`, it gets the average hash and compares the hash of every image towards the image that you put into the program.

## How Can I use it

> Note. This is incomplete

You will need to have python 3.6.7 or above installed with pip.

1. Make sure you have internet connection and clone this reopsitory (or download as zip), and make your terminal's current directory (on windows open cmd and type `cd <path/to/flagpole>`). 
2. If you have it as your current directory, type `pip install requirements.txt --trusted-ost pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org` and wait for the requirements to install.
3. If you are on windows, then extract the contents of `flagpole.zip` to somewhere you will remember or if you are on linux, extract the contents of the `flagpole.tar.gz` file.
4. Run `flagpole.py`, enter the path to the extracted file (from step 3) without qoutes. eg. `C:\\Users\simplebinary\Flagpole` not `"C:\\Users\simplebinary\Flagpole"` or if you are on linux `path/to/Falgpole`, not `"path/to/Flagpole"`.
5. Take picture or download picture of flag off the internet and give the path to that image.
6. Wait for the results.
